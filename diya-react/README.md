## 🚀 Tech Stack

DIYA is built with a modern, "best-in-class" technology stack focused on visual excellence and smooth interactions:

*   **⚛️ Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) (Latest stable)
*   **⚡ Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (For near-instant HMR)
*   **🎭 Animation**: [GSAP 3](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (Advanced timelines, scroll triggers, and morphing)
*   **🌊 Smooth Scroll**: [Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis) (For a high-end cinematic feel)
*   **🛣️ Routing**: [React Router 7](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
*   **🎨 Styling**: Vanilla CSS with a modular "Premium Aesthetics" system:
    *   **Glassmorphism**: High-blur backdrops and sub-additive borders.
    *   **Noise Textures**: Custom SVG grain overlays for tactile UI depth.
    *   **3D Effects**: Interactive mouse-follow tilt and dynamic perspective shifts.

## 🏗️ System Design

DIYA's frontend follows a **State-Driven Animation** architecture:

1.  **Component-Based UI**: Atomic design principles applied to React components.
2.  **Animation Controllers**: GSAP timelines are integrated into `useEffect` and triggered by React state changes (e.g., transition from `progress` to `success` in OAuth).
3.  **Dynamic Theming**: Brand-specific colors and backgrounds are injected via CSS variables and React hooks.
4.  **Spotlight Isolation**: A central "Spotlight" modal system that uses backdrop filters and perspective transforms to focus user attention.
